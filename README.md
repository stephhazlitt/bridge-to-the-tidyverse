## readxl: the bridge to the tidyverse

I have become a regular user and fan of [readxl](http://readxl.tidyverse.org/), an R package that makes it easy to get data out of Excel and into R. Here are a few reasons why:


**readxl is a bridge for users**

I have been in the data analysis business for awhile&mdash;mostly collecting and analyzing data to answer research questions in various topics in biology. A few years ago, I was exposed to the importane of machine readable data, I was introduced to cpncepts reproduceable and open science, and I started to learn R.my approach to anything data-related had a complete makeover. More than a makeover really,  a complete change&mdash;my work pre and post  overhaul 


**readxl does one thing well**




**Clippy**
Hex logos and stickers are fun and kind of a thing for R packages now. I love stickers&mdash;and the readxl logo with Clippy's sad face makes me smile, everytime-I-see-it. I was an Excel user in Clippy's time. I never really understood the animousity for [Clippy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant)


Data import packages are sometimes easy to overlook when gushing about R packages&mdash;outshone by packages that help users really make data sing, like generating beautiful graphics using ggplot2 or turning super messy data into a tidy data frame using tidyr. The readxl package, in my opinion, as an easy to use, reliable data import package for .xls and .xlsx files&mdash;creating a bridge to the tidyverse for new R users and many other data analysis communities. 


#### More on the tidyverse and readxl

 The readxl package is part of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), a set of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) packages for doing data science&mdash;helping R users get, clean, analyze and visualize data with packages that are purposely designed to work nicely together and help users develop 'tidy' work flows.
